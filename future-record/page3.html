        Line Rider is an internet game, with versions available for Microsoft Silverlight, Javascript, Windows, and Flash. It was originally created in September 2006 by Boštjan Čadež (also known as "fšk"), a Slovenian student. Soon after its initial appearance on DeviantArt, Line Rider became an internet phenomenon.
